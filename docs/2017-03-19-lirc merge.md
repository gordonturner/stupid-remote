2017-03-19-lirc merge
=====================

- lirc changes are on the 2017-02-10-lirc-support branch

- By merging cec code back into 2017-02-10-lirc-support, cec-client code is required
- This may not be ideal:
  - In some cases cec-client is not required
  - The latest cec-client must be compiled from source

- Current code on avswitch:/home/pi/stupid-remote is synced with the 2017-02-10-lirc-support branch


- The current cec code is in develop and master
